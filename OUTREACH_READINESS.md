# Outreach Readiness (Pre-Push Gate)

## Status summary
- [x] Offers defined with scope and boundaries
- [x] Deliverables template included
- [x] Claims mapped to concrete evidence lines
- [x] Case cards prepared
- [x] Sanitization review summary present

## Still recommended before first public push
- [ ] Add one short contact CTA block (email/form/link)
- [ ] Decide commercial framing language (freelance vs studio)
- [ ] Add explicit support window per offer (e.g., 3 days async follow-up)
- [ ] Optional: add one screenshot (sanitized) from verification output

## Risk note
Do not claim enterprise SLA/compliance penetration-testing capabilities unless separate evidence and contracts exist.

## Suggested decision
You can start outreach now with current repo and refine positioning in parallel.


## Portfolio strengthening done
- Added anonymized sample delivery packs for setup+tts and monitoring baseline to improve buyer confidence before first live customer references.
