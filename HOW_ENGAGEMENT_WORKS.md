1. **Initial contact**
   - Client shares goal and urgency.
2. **Intake**
   - `INTAKE_FORM.md` completed.
3. **Scope confirmation**
   - package selected + acceptance criteria written.
4. **Execution window**
   - work performed in agreed slot.
5. **Verification**
   - PASS/WARN/FAIL evidence collected.
6. **Delivery pack handover**
   - based on `DELIVERY_PACK_TEMPLATE.md`.
7. **Follow-up window**
   - async reply target: within 2 business days
   - typical support window: 3–6 business days (complexity-dependent)
