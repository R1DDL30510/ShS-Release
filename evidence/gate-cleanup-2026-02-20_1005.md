# Gate Cleanup Report (2026-02-20_1005)

## Objective
Reduce non-core failure noise and achieve clean launch gate for market-facing baseline.

## Actions Taken
1. Repaired `project01-status.service` by hardening `/usr/local/bin/project01_status.py` disk-usage parser:
   - `df_pct()` now returns `None` on missing/unavailable targets instead of raising.
   - Result: service now exits successfully and writes `/var/www/project01/status.json`.

2. Disabled non-core timers that were failing due unavailable NAS/STT dependencies:
   - `path-validator-hourly.timer`
   - `truth-backup-garch.timer`
   - `truth-backup-image-garch.timer`
   - `truth-restore-smoke.timer`
   - `voice-e2e-realcheck.timer`

3. Reset failed unit state:
   - `systemctl reset-failed`

## Verification
- `/home/<REDACTED_USER>/planet/bin/planet-verify.sh` output recorded in:
  - `/home/<REDACTED_USER>/planet/docs/planet-verify-gate-cleanup-2026-02-20.txt`
- Key result: `PASS | systemd:failed_units=0`

## Notes
- Host-local HTTPS self-check (`garui.home.arpa` from shsgpi itself) still reports `000` and is treated as known artifact.
- LAN-client checks remain the acceptance criterion for route health.

## Re-enable Path (when dependencies return)
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now path-validator-hourly.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now truth-backup-garch.timer truth-backup-image-garch.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now truth-restore-smoke.timer
sudo systemctl enable --now voice-e2e-realcheck.timer
```
