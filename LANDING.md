# Secure Home Systems — Evidence-Backed AI Ops Services

Pragmatic support for local/self-hosted AI stacks (OpenWebUI, Ollama, TTS, launch-gate stabilization).

## Why clients hire this
- Systems are unstable or noisy before a demo/launch
- Integrations work "sometimes" but not reproducibly
- Team needs verifiable outputs, not vague promises
