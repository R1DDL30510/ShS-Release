## Template 1 — LinkedIn/X (short)
I just published an **evidence-backed pre-launch portfolio** for local/self-hosted AI ops services.

Focus areas:
- AI Stack Rescue
- Local AI Setup + TTS
- Ops Audit + Launch Gate
- Monitoring Baseline (read-only)

No hype—just verifiable artifacts and explicit scope boundaries.

Repo: https://github.com/R1DDL30510/gar-release  
Release: https://github.com/R1DDL30510/gar-release/releases/tag/v0.1.0-prelaunch

If your stack is unstable or launch-noisy, feel free to reach out.

## Template 2 — Community (problem/solution)
Built a small evidence-first service portfolio for local/self-hosted AI environments.

Common issues addressed:
- unstable integrations
- unclear failure states
- missing launch-gate clarity

Published as a public pre-launch repo with verify artifacts, scope boundaries, delivery templates, and strict acceptance criteria.
