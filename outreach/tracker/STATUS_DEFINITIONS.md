# Outreach Status Definitions

- `new` = contact/source identified, no interaction yet
- `posted` = public platform post published
- `engaged` = someone reacted/commented/DM'd
- `intake_sent` = intake link/form sent
- `qualified` = intake complete and package fit confirmed
- `proposal_ready` = scope + acceptance criteria drafted
- `won` = project confirmed
- `lost` = not moving forward

## Rule
No execution starts before `qualified`.
