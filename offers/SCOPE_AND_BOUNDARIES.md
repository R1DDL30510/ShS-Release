# Scope & Boundaries (Client-Facing)

## What is in scope
- Local/self-hosted AI stack diagnosis and recovery
- OpenWebUI / Ollama / local TTS integration and stabilization
- Reproducible verification outputs (health checks, command logs, before/after)
- Rollback-oriented change steps

## What is out of scope (unless explicitly agreed)
- 24/7 on-call and SLA-backed operations
- Enterprise compliance certification (ISO/SOC2/GDPR legal audit)
- Full penetration testing / red-team assessments
- Hardware repair/replacement
- Third-party service uptime guarantees

## Assumptions for fixed-price offers
- Working SSH/admin access exists
- Host OS is reachable and not physically damaged
- Required dependencies are allowed by host policy
- Scope is limited to stated duration/package

## Risk/Limit note
Work is provided on a best-effort basis for self-hosted environments with many external variables. Deliverables focus on verifiable operational improvement, not absolute permanence.
